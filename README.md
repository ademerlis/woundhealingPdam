### Molecular signatures of the innate immune response in the early hours of wound healing in *Pocillopora damicornis* ###

We hypothesize that the first hours of wound healing in reef-building corals involve significant upregulation of genes implicated in the coral innate immune system in order to prevent infection at the injury site. To test this, we wounded 18 fragments of one genotype of Pocillopora damicornis and collected tissue samples at each hour, up to five hours post-injury, for coral host differential gene expression analysis in comparison to 18 unwounded controls.

This repository contains the scripts for the bioinformatics pipeline used to process the raw sequences, as well as the R markdown documents for data analysis.
